Okay, let’s build the thing that makes every existing HIS/EHR look like a DOS terminal.

I’ll give you:
	1.	North Star & Design Principles
	2.	End-state Architecture Overview
	3.	Deep Domain & Workflow Design (clinical, CRM/PRM, billing, nursing, devices, research, etc.)
	4.	Agent & AI Layer – in detail
	5.	Data, Security, Compliance, Governance
	6.	Migration & Coexistence with Legacy EHRs (Athma/EPIC/Cerner/etc.)
	7.	Phased Roadmap – painfully detailed (Phase 0 → Phase 5)

Use this as the “Mother RFC” you can keep slicing into more specific specs, prompt packs, and file-by-file build plans.

⸻

1. North Star & Design Principles

1.1 North Star

A single, longitudinal, FHIR-native patient & provider graph with agentic workflows layered on top, where every interaction (call, chat, visit, bill, lab, nurse task) is:
	•	captured once,
	•	understood by AI agents,
	•	mapped to structured clinical + operational data,
	•	re-used everywhere (care, operations, billing, research).

Concretely:
	•	No duplicate data entry.
	•	No “forms first” design.
	•	LLM agents are first-class operators in the system, not bolted-on chatbots.

⸻

1.2 Non-Negotiable Design Principles
	1.	Patient Graph, not Screens
Everything is a node/edge on a shared graph: Patient, Conditions, Encounters, Tasks, Communications, Bills, Insurance, Devices, etc.
	2.	Conversation-First, Form-Second
Default interaction is natural language (voice/text) → agents infer structured data → minimal confirmation UIs for humans.
	3.	Agents Only Act via Tools
LLMs never directly touch DBs. They call strongly typed tools / APIs (book_appointment, propose_orders, generate_discharge_summary) with narrow scope.
	4.	FHIR + Internal Protocol
Use FHIR for clinical semantics + an internal “Operational Protocol” for CRM, billing, scheduling, etc. Everything map-able to FHIR if needed.
	5.	Event-Driven Spine
Every important change emits events (Appointment.Created, Encounter.Updated, LabResult.Finalized, Invoice.Settled, CarePlan.Changed), which agents subscribe to.
	6.	Safety & Auditability Built-in
Every AI output is traceable: model version, prompt, tools, context, human approval. Clear separation between “suggested” vs “clinician-attested”.
	7.	Composable & Vendor-Agnostic
Must coexist with EPIC/Cerner/Athma/etc. via HL7/FHIR interfaces. Our system can be overlay, sidecar, or full core.
	8.	Role-Centric UX
	•	Patient
	•	Clinician (doctor, nurse, therapist, pharmacist)
	•	Admin / front desk
	•	Finance / billing / RCM
	•	Call centre / contact-centre
	•	Management & quality
Each gets tailored UI + agent support.

⸻

2. End-State Architecture Overview

Think of it as 6 big layers:
	1.	Channels & Experience Layer (apps, portals, telephony, WhatsApp)
	2.	Agent & Orchestration Layer (LLM agents, tool registry, safety engine)
	3.	Core Health Platform (EHR, PRM/CRM, scheduling, billing, tasks, orders, inventory)
	4.	Data & Intelligence Layer (analytics, ML models, vector stores, feature store)
	5.	Integration Layer (FHIR/HL7/REST bridges to legacy systems, policy engines)
	6.	Platform Ops & Governance (RBAC/ABAC, auditing, config, tenant mgmt, observability)

I’ll now go subsystem by subsystem.

4. Agent & AI Layer – Excruciating Detail

4.1 Agent Taxonomy
	1.	Channel Agents – bound to a channel (WhatsApp, IVR, web).
	2.	Domain Agents – specialized by domain (triage, scribe, orders, billing).
	3.	Supervisor Agents – orchestrate domain agents, handle escalation.
	4.	Guardian Agents – policy & safety enforcement, adversarial checks.
	5.	Analytics Agents – summarization, pattern detection, research support.

⸻

4.2 Tooling Protocol Design

Each tool exposed to agents has:
	•	name: e.g., book_appointment
	•	description: plain language, strict purpose
	•	input_schema: JSON Schema
	•	output_schema: JSON
	•	permissions: which roles/agents can use it
	•	safety_class: A/B/C (informational vs suggestive vs direct action)

Example (conceptual):

{
  "name": "create_medication_request",
  "description": "Create a proposed medication request for a patient. Must be reviewed by a clinician.",
  "safety_class": "B",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "patient_id": { "type": "string" },
      "encounter_id": { "type": "string" },
      "drug_code": { "type": "string" },
      "dose": { "type": "string" },
      "route": { "type": "string" },
      "frequency": { "type": "string" },
      "duration": { "type": "string" },
      "indication": { "type": "string" }
    },
    "required": ["patient_id", "encounter_id", "drug_code", "dose", "route", "frequency"]
  }
}

Agents never call generic “run SQL”; only these tools.

⸻

4.3 Safety Classes
	•	Class A (Informational)
	•	summarise_notes, explain_lab_result_to_patient.
	•	Can act autonomously; only display.
	•	Class B (Suggestive)
	•	propose_diagnosis_codes, draft_discharge_summary, suggest_orders.
	•	Must be explicitly accepted/edited by human.
	•	Class C (Operational Action)
	•	book_appointment, send_patient_message, create_invoice.
	•	Some allowed with policy constraints; others require human confirmation.

Policy Engine enforces:
	•	which agent may use which tool, in which context,
	•	preconditions (e.g. no discharge without nurse sign-off).

⸻

4.4 Orchestration Flow
	1.	Channel event: patient message / call / UI action.
	2.	Orchestrator:
	•	identifies intent & context (which patient, which episode).
	•	picks primary domain agent(s).
	3.	Domain agent:
	•	retrieves context via tools (get_patient, get_active_episodes, etc.),
	•	reasons via LLM,
	•	calls tools to propose actions.
	4.	Guardian agent:
	•	checks actions against policies & risk patterns.
	5.	Output:
	•	actions executed or presented for human approval.

All steps logged in an “AI Interaction Log” for audit.

⸻

4.5 Model Strategy
	•	Mix of:
	•	general LLMs (core reasoning),
	•	domain-fine tuned models (clinical, billing),
	•	small models for edge/on-prem deployment (privacy).
	•	Use retrieval (RAG) for:
	•	hospital policies,
	•	local clinical guidelines & order sets,
	•	payer rules.

Long-term:
	•	track performance metrics per agent per model,
	•	support hot-swapping models with rollback.

⸻

5. Data, Security, Compliance, Governance

5.1 Data Architecture
	•	Operational DBs:
	•	FHIR store (Postgres + JSONB / Mongo, etc.),
	•	scheduling/billing/queues (relational).
	•	Events Bus:
	•	Kafka/Pulsar/NATS; events schema versioned.

	•	in emergencies, allow broader access with heavy logging.
	•	Encryption:
	•	at rest & in transit,

⸻

5.3 AI Governance

	•	bias detection,
	•	hallucination cases,
	•	harmful suggestion tracking.
	•	Periodic reviews:
	•	transcript sampling,

⸻

6. Integration & Migration Strategy
	•	Start as overlay:
	•	Use FHIR/HL7 to sync with Athma/EPIC/Cerner.
	•	Keep our system as the agentic, UX & CRM layer.
	•	Gradually move:
	•	new workflows into our system (start with OPD + PRM).
	•	old EHR becomes backend data source.
	•	Design:
	•	a “Connector Gateway” that:
	•	normalizes different EHR APIs → our internal protocol,
	•	handles mapping & transformations.
