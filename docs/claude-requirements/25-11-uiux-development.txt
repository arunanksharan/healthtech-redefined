for  AI Assistant Chat Widget -> ultrathink and do the following:

  1. You do not need to create a widget from scratch.
  2. You should instead use - AI SDK by vercel -> "https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/ai-sdk-ui" alongwith shadcn to build this out.
  3. Ensure the tech stack used is as mentioned in the original setup.
  4. Ensure the entire UI/UX is in sync and consistent with the backend apis and development done so far 

  ultrathink and implement the ui/ux described in the folder : "/Users/paruljuniwal/kuzushi_labs/healthcare/healthtech-redefined/docs/implement/epics-ux".
  1. Go at it one by one and slowly, methodically, systematically, rigorously. Do not try to implement all the files at once. plan it one after another and ensure nothing is missed.
  You can refer to docs and other project folders as needed.

  Write the code in the frontend folder. Update it, remove redundant stuff as appropriate and build this out systematically and properly.3
