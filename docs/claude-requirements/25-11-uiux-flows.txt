UI/UX flows:

You are a world class expert at building customer relationship management (CRM) products.
You have visualised and built multi-billion dollar products on CRMs.

You are tasked with building such a CRM for healthcare context. You call it Patient Relationship Management (PRM).

Think like a visionary product expert in 2025.
Keep in mind the latest technology around generative AI -> LLMs and AI agents being available.

Based on this what are the key questions you would like to ask and explore to build out a multibillion dollar awe-inspriting product.

You have a suite of products already through which data will come into the PRM and go out of PRM (actions).

1. Zoice -> zoice.ai -> telephony & voice-based conversational AI -> passes audio recordings of calls and transcripts via webhooks. You do not need to understand or know about Zoice. You just need to know that one of the entrypoints into the PRM will be via zoice

2. Whatsapp based chatbot -> similar to zoice.ai, we have a text and audio based chatbot which can support whatsapp for the flows like - Appointment Booking, QR-code based Checkin, Pre-visit instructions, FAQs etc. Again, you do not need to worry about the specifics of this tool. You just need to think about an interface to receive relevant data from Whatsapp and process it as required


3. Web App and Mobile app with AI avatars and similar AI assistants as the third ingress point into the system

You need to think as a product designer and create a world class CRM UI/UX flows/journey descriptions which AI assisted coding tools like Cursor can use to build out the frontend.

Think what a typical CRM/PRM would look like in this context.
Think in terms of having the capability to do everything through a chatbot (text and voice) interface instead of form filling.

DO not provide code.
Provide a detailed set of description of the user journneys/flows.

Example: 
1. There is a sidebar with buttons for Organisation, Doctors, Patients, Departments, Slots (all FHIR entities) and their listview, detail view and ability to perform CRUD operations on them

2. There is an AI assistant widget on the bottom right side which can take in text and audio and convert users input into structured output and fill in the relevant forms (eg: add 1PM to 2PM slot for Doctor Rohit Sharma from Cardiology | add a 2PM appointment for patient -> 9844111173 with dr. virat kohli from orthopaedics at Surya Whitefield)

3. There is a detailed analytics dashboard with AI assistant supporting the queries 

I want to start with the plans for a great CRM UI/UX with AI assitant native capabilities using the backend for prm-service and other modules we have built.

Below are some <Reference Ideas and Journeys to Consider>. Make sure you evalaute this and consider only the flows and feasible things which are consistent to the backend already built and do not require any significant additional backend development.


<Reference Ideas and Journeys to Consider>
Part 1: The Visionary Framework

The "Contextual" Feed: How do we unify a 10-minute audio rant from Zoice, a quick WhatsApp confirmation, and a clinical note into a single, chronological "Story of the Patient" without the doctor opening three different tabs?

Plan this later in the roadmap: Proactive Agents: Instead of waiting for a user to query "Show me empty slots," can the PRM proactively float a notification: "Dr. Sharma has 3 cancellations tomorrow. Should I blast a WhatsApp message to the waiting list via the chatbot?"

Part 2: PRM Architecture & User Journeys (Prompt for Cursor)
Tech Stack Context for the AI Builder:

Frontend: React/Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/UI (for clean, accessible components).

State: Real-time updates (Sockets) for incoming Zoice/WhatsApp webhooks.


Journey 1: The "Omni-Inbox" (The Central Nervous System)
This replaces the traditional "Dashboard" as the landing page.

Description for implementation:

Layout: Three-column layout.

Left: Universal Sidebar (collapsed by default, expands on hover).

Middle (Wide): The "Live Feed." This acts like a Twitter/Facebook feed but for hospital operations.

Right: Contextual "Action Panel" (Dynamic).

Data Ingestion Flow:

Zoice Integration: When a webhook hits, a card appears in the Feed: "Incoming Call Analysis - Patient John Doe." It displays the sentiment (e.g., Frustrated), the intent (e.g., Rescheduling), and a summary bullet list.

WhatsApp Integration: Messages appear as chat bubbles within the feed cards. "Patient uploaded Insurance Card via WhatsApp."

UX Interaction:

The user clicks a "Zoice Call" card.

Action: The Right Panel slides out. It doesn't show a form. It shows "Suggested Actions" generated by LLM.

Button 1: "Reschedule to Tuesday 2 PM" (System detects this requested time in the transcript).

Button 2: "Callback Agent" (Trigger a voice bot to call them back).

Visuals: Use distinct iconography for Voice (Zoice), Text (WhatsApp), and System (App). Color-code based on Urgency (Red for angry sentiment, Green for inquiries).

Journey 2: The "Generative" Patient Profile (Patient 360)
Moving away from static tabs to a narrative view.

Description for implementation:

Header: Patient Name, Avatar, and a "Health Score" (AI-calculated engagement metric).

The Narrative View (Main Content):

Instead of tables for "Visits," "Labs," "Notes," create a Vertical Timeline.

Smart Grouping: The timeline aggregates events. Example: "Cardiology Episode (Oct 10 - Oct 15)." Clicking this expands to show the Zoice call that started it, the Appointment booking, the Visit summary, and the WhatsApp follow-up.

The "Ask Patient Data" Feature:

Place a large search bar at the top of the profile.

User Query: "Show me the trend of his blood pressure from the last 5 visits."

System Response: The UI dynamically renders a Line Chart right there in the chat stream, extracting data from FHIR observations.

User Query: "Draft a referral letter to Dr. Virat based on the last consultation."

System Response: Generates a PDF preview in the chat stream.

Journey 3: The "Copilot" Command Bar (The Form Killer)
This is the primary input method for the entire application.

Description for implementation:

Component: A floating, modal-like bar (similar to Spotlight Search on Mac or Ctrl+K menus) accessible globally.

Modes:

Text Mode: Type "Book follow-up for Sarah Jones with Dr. Kohli next Tuesday."

Voice Mode (Mic Icon): The user holds the spacebar and speaks instructions.

The "Drafting" State:

As the user speaks/types, the UI creates a "Ghost Card" in the center of the screen.

The LLM parses entities: {Patient: Sarah Jones}, {Doctor: Virat Kohli}, {Intent: Appointment}, {Time: Tuesday}.

The UI displays these fields visually (not as input boxes, but as tags).

Correction Flow: If the AI gets it wrong (e.g., Wrong Sarah), the user clicks the "Sarah Jones" tag and selects the correct one from a dropdown.

Confirmation: User presses "Execute." The system hits the FHIR endpoints to write the data and returns a "Success" toast.

Journey 4: "Org & Roster" Management via Natural Language
Managing Doctors, Departments, and Slots (FHIR Entities).

Description for implementation:

View: A Kanban or Calendar view for Doctor Rosters.

Problem: Changing rosters is usually tedious (click, drag, edit time, save).

The Solution (Agentic Modification):

User opens the "Cardiology" Department view.

User engages the Assistant: "Dr. Rohit is on leave next week. Move all his appointments to Dr. Gill and block his calendar."

UX Flow:

The system greys out Dr. Rohit's row.

A modal appears: "I found 12 conflicting appointments."

"Drafted WhatsApp messages to all 12 patients informing them of the doctor change. Send now?"

User clicks "Approve."

Visual Feedback: The slots visually fly from Dr. Rohit's column to Dr. Gill's column.

Journey 5: Analytics & "Pulse" Dashboard
Strategic decision-making.

Description for implementation:

Layout: Bento-grid style dashboard (modular tiles).

Dynamic Tiles:

Sentiment Heatmap: Visualizes data from Zoice and WhatsApp. Shows a map of the hospital departments. Red areas indicate where patient conversations are negative/frustrated.

No-Show Predictor: A list of upcoming appointments flagged with a "High No-Show Risk" tag (based on past behavior).

Interaction:

User hovers over "High No-Show Risk" tile.

Context Action: "Activate Confirmation Bot."

System triggers the WhatsApp bot to send a specific "Please confirm your slot" message to just those high-risk users.
