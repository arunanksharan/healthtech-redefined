## Conclusion

The current platform is missing **85% of features** required for a world-class healthcare solution. To achieve the multi-billion dollar vision:

1. **Investment needed:** $12M development + $7.8M team = **$20M total**
2. **Timeline:** 18 months with full team
3. **Feature gap:** 127 major features missing
4. **Revenue impact:** $485M difference by Year 5

**Critical Decision:**
- **Option A:** Invest $20M to build world-class platform → $500M revenue by Year 5
- **Option B:** Continue with basic features → $15M revenue by Year 5, acquisition target
- **Option C:** Partner/acquire existing platform → Faster but less differentiation

**Recommendation:** Secure Series A funding of $25M to build world-class features and capture significant market share in the $100B+ healthcare IT market.
