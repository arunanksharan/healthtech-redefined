**[ACTION: Press Enter]**

**[VISUAL: AI processes request]**

**[ACTION: Press Enter]**

**[VISUAL: AI shows Michael's appointments]**

**[NARRATION]**
The AI knows "he" refers to Michael Johnson because that's who we were just discussing.

**[ACTION: Press Enter]**

**[VISUAL: AI shows message preview]**

**[NARRATION]**
Confirm, and the AI sends reminders to everyone.

**[PAUSE: 1 second]**

**[NARRATION]**
Let's talk about phrasing. The AI is flexible, but being specific helps.

**[VISUAL: Split screen showing different phrasings]**

**[ACTION: Type "book appt john tomorrow 2pm"]**

**[NARRATION]**
This casual phrasing works fine...

**[VISUAL: AI understands and responds]**

**[ACTION: Type "Book appointment for John Doe on November 25, 2024 at 14:00"]**

**[NARRATION]**
...but being more specific reduces ambiguity and errors.

**[ACTION: Press Enter]**

**[VISUAL: AI understands correction]**

**[NARRATION]**
This is multi-step workflow automation at its finest!

**[PAUSE: 1 second]**

**[NARRATION]**
One last tip: use the command bar for quick actions.
