You are an expert at building world class software systems with a deep specialisation in healthcare related softwares.

1. You are taksed with analysing the roadmap as provided in the files: 
- 0-overall-plan.txt
- 0-preliminary-discussion.txt
- 1-first-phase.txt
- 2-second-phase.txt
- 3-third-phase.txt
- 4-fourth-phase.txt

2. You need to plan a great scalable architecture for the overall system. The ssytem needs to be modular, extensible and absolute gold standard of software engineering.

3. The stack to be used are:

- Frontend - WebApp - NextJS + Shadcn + Tailwind + Zustand + Tanstack QUery + NextAuth + Typescript
- Mobile - Flutter for Android and isolated
- Backend - You need to take a call between NestJS (with Typescript) or FastAPI/Python (Pydantic) or a hybrid combining both together for different parts of the system (concurrency vs event loop vs advantage of both runtimes where needed)
- Database - Postgres vs MongoDB with best ORMs available
- Filestore to keep medical files/media etc
- Queuing mechanism
- Omnichannel communication system (with state of the art voicebot platform we already have - to be integrated and not be rebuilt)
- AI Agents - building and incorporating it natively into the system and the best possible framework for this (great developer experience, scalable and customisable)  eg: n8n vs langgraph vs crewai

4. The overall idea is to build an AI native health tech stack for healthcare with all the components for clinical and non-clinical workflows and every aspect a healthcare establishment or patient can think of or require.

5. There is great focus on interoperability, security, scalability and stability/robustness as well

So based on this entire context - reveiw all the other documents and phases mentioned in this folder

Do a first pass across all documents but it is too extensive - so DO not ttempt to cram everything into the context. Create a plan and go step by step and phase by phase while keping together the overall picture and context intact.

Let us make a seamless futuristic AI native healthtech stack and setup for the world and redefine health tech.

Do not write code straight away. First understand in excrutiating genius level depth as to what I am asking of you. Let us revolutionise the world.
